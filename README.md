As a part of 2022 TJPhO we had to investigate what would happen if a satellite hits JWST at L2, and yeets it from original orbit.

Suppose when the Earth is at the point closest to the Sun, the perihelion, the JWST, with a mass of 6161.4 kg, is stationed at the L2 point in stable orbit. Suppose a rogue satellite, of mass 2547.3 kg, collides with the JWST such that both satellites remain intact. At the point of instantaneous collision, the velocity of the asteroid is 3000m/s, parallel to the velocity of the JWST which we consider to be in the +j direction. For the below problems, use the standard numerical values for the mass of the Earth and Sun.


We used a simple push pull method of acceleration to get the velocity change every 5 seconds.

Assuming elastic collision, plot the trajectory of both the JWST and the rogue satellite through the first 30 days after collision. Provide the final positions of both satellites at the end of the time period. Explain with reasoning what type of equilibrium exists at the L2 point?

Final position after 30 days:
Final position of satellite is (126525108797.94 m, 36743210893.05 m) which is at a distance of
131752292970.79 m from Sun.
Final position of asteroid is (128998509025.87 m, 107963329184.29 m) which is at a distance of
168216217349.73 from Sun.


As soon as JWST is perturbed from L2 orbit, it didnt return, hence it is unstable equilibrium. This
is also justified theoretically, as if it pushed in, the grav. forces will push it towards sun further and
there is nothing restoring it

We run the code for 365 days, to get the distance from L2 as a function of time
